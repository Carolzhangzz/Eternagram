        "But it's a good perspective to keep, acknowledging that collective efforts matter. Do you ever feel like efforts to improve the situation are futile?",
        "So, do you think it's important to stay informed about the issues affecting our world? We should all have the right to know, after all. How important do you think it is to stay clued up on what's happening around us?"
