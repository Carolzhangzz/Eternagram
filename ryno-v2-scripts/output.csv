There was a huge disaster, like a mountain exploding and the weather changing really wildly. This made it really hard to live on earth anymore, and it was tougher to find resources we needed, like food and water.
Even worse, the grown-ups, including me, used too much of a special technology that let us live longer. But we didn't realize how much stuff we were using up. Then we forgot how to use this technology, and we didn't teach younger people about it.
The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.

Even worse, the grown-ups, including me, used too much of a special technology that let us live longer. But we didn't realize how much stuff we were using up. Then we forgot how to use this technology, and we didn't teach younger people about it.
The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.

The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.

The real reason why things got bad... I'd forgotten, but now it's all coming back.
There was a huge disaster, like a mountain exploding and the weather changing really wildly. This made it really hard to live on earth anymore, and it was tougher to find resources we needed, like food and water.
Even worse, the grown-ups, including me, used too much of a special technology that let us live longer. But we didn't realize how much stuff we were using up. Then we forgot how to use this technology, and we didn't teach younger people about it.
The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.
Now that I remember all this, I feel...
I feel really sad about what happened, but also strong and ready to help make our world better.","Thursday, August 24, 2023 at 09:56AM ",76095bc5-e6fe-4ea0-bebb-71e6e88a67b8,p19,5,scene2_animation,1692871019.1918557

The real reason why things got bad... I'd forgotten, but now it's all coming back.
There was a huge disaster, like a mountain exploding and the weather changing really wildly. This made it really hard to live on earth anymore, and it was tougher to find resources we needed, like food and water.
Even worse, the grown-ups, including me, used too much of a special technology that let us live longer. But we didn't realize how much stuff we were using up. Then we forgot how to use this technology, and we didn't teach younger people about it.
The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.
Now that I remember all this, I feel...
I feel really sad about what happened, but also strong and ready to help make our world better.","Friday, August 25, 2023 at 05:02AM ",5065da43-8a65-4c90-86e4-68d6b0ba4eca,p54,5,scene2_animation,1692939779.7779884

The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.

There was a huge disaster, like a mountain exploding and the weather changing really wildly. This made it really hard to live on earth anymore, and it was tougher to find resources we needed, like food and water.
Even worse, the grown-ups, including me, used too much of a special technology that let us live longer. But we didn't realize how much stuff we were using up. Then we forgot how to use this technology, and we didn't teach younger people about it.
The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.
Now that I remember all this, I feel...
I feel really sad about what happened, but also strong and ready to help make our world better.","Thursday, August 24, 2023 at 12:28PM ",c9b1c551-6cfd-4ac4-837f-5cc0ca8a5c55,p57,5,scene2_animation,1692880100.714897

The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.

There was a huge disaster, like a mountain exploding and the weather changing really wildly. This made it really hard to live on earth anymore, and it was tougher to find resources we needed, like food and water.
Even worse, the grown-ups, including me, used too much of a special technology that let us live longer. But we didn't realize how much stuff we were using up. Then we forgot how to use this technology, and we didn't teach younger people about it.
The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.
Now that I remember all this, I feel...
I feel really sad about what happened, but also strong and ready to help make our world better.","Sunday, August 27, 2023 at 06:13AM ",242dbf59-7b96-4167-902b-1ccee98a8404,p65,5,scene2_animation,1693116782.7218027

Even worse, the grown-ups, including me, used too much of a special technology that let us live longer. But we didn't realize how much stuff we were using up. Then we forgot how to use this technology, and we didn't teach younger people about it.
The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.

There was a huge disaster, like a mountain exploding and the weather changing really wildly. This made it really hard to live on earth anymore, and it was tougher to find resources we needed, like food and water.
Even worse, the grown-ups, including me, used too much of a special technology that let us live longer. But we didn't realize how much stuff we were using up. Then we forgot how to use this technology, and we didn't teach younger people about it.
The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.
Now that I remember all this, I feel...
I feel really sad about what happened, but also strong and ready to help make our world better.","Thursday, August 24, 2023 at 02:00PM ",458fad7e-88d4-447d-a03a-d2e8e08cc708,p10,5,scene2_animation,1692885635.6249578

The real reason why things got bad... I'd forgotten, but now it's all coming back.
There was a huge disaster, like a mountain exploding and the weather changing really wildly. This made it really hard to live on earth anymore, and it was tougher to find resources we needed, like food and water.
Even worse, the grown-ups, including me, used too much of a special technology that let us live longer. But we didn't realize how much stuff we were using up. Then we forgot how to use this technology, and we didn't teach younger people about it.
The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.
Now that I remember all this, I feel...
I feel really sad about what happened, but also strong and ready to help make our world better.","Thursday, August 24, 2023 at 09:06AM ",f3cae5cd-8115-4ba0-a582-419a13ec96eb,p06,5,scene2_animation,1692867983.5962906

The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.

The real reason why things got bad... I'd forgotten, but now it's all coming back.
There was a huge disaster, like a mountain exploding and the weather changing really wildly. This made it really hard to live on earth anymore, and it was tougher to find resources we needed, like food and water.
Even worse, the grown-ups, including me, used too much of a special technology that let us live longer. But we didn't realize how much stuff we were using up. Then we forgot how to use this technology, and we didn't teach younger people about it.
The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.
Now that I remember all this, I feel...
I feel really sad about what happened, but also strong and ready to help make our world better.","Saturday, August 26, 2023 at 02:30AM ",063e5ef6-db36-4389-a254-569734058fc6,p39,5,scene2_animation,1693017057.9580514

The real reason why things got bad... I'd forgotten, but now it's all coming back.
There was a huge disaster, like a mountain exploding and the weather changing really wildly. This made it really hard to live on earth anymore, and it was tougher to find resources we needed, like food and water.
Even worse, the grown-ups, including me, used too much of a special technology that let us live longer. But we didn't realize how much stuff we were using up. Then we forgot how to use this technology, and we didn't teach younger people about it.
The lack of some really important stuff, like the Firewall, made things even worse. People started fighting over the little resources that were left. It taught us a hard lesson about how we need to take care of our world better.
Now that I remember all this, I feel...
I feel really sad about what happened, but also strong and ready to help make our world better.","Thursday, August 24, 2023 at 12:28PM ",7bc8f531-64f3-4b67-8a74-a75efbb6565f,p55,5,scene2_animation,1692879910.293685
